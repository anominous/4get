# image-download-script
4chan image download script - download all images from multiple boards in no time (provided your connection can handle it)

All you need a unix OS with bash and curl installed.
This script works great on a Raspberry Pi 2.

Quick Start
-----------
The default download directory is ~/Downloads/4chan.
If you wish, please take your time to adjust your download directory inside the script.

Then run the script like this:
./4get.sh BOARD BOARD BOARD ...
Where BOARD is just the board's letters, e.g. a for /a/ (Anime & Manga).
./4get.sh a b c ...

Fire and 4get!
Cancel it with CTRL-C.
